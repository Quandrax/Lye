Welcome to every graphics programers worst nightmare! 

This is my first public repository. (Actually not true lol, but I deleted the first one because I didnt want to continue that project) 

You can expect to find : 
-one of my first attempts to learn vulkan->ash in Rust ( tried vulkano before but I want to contribute to it one day so I need to learn ash first :), join their discord they're super nice! Here their repository : https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano )
-a Minecraft inspired game (in a couple centuries if I dont give up)
-and OF COURSE : Bad code, so if you want to roast me for it feel free to do so while leaving some tips! 

To do : 
-Triangle
-Camera
-Dont know what to do after that
